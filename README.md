A markdown text editor that generates a realtime Preview according to the Editor content. 
The idea behind this project is to make a simple but useful application integrating frameworks and other features.

- Use of **React+Vite** as a javascript framework for developing the page.
- Simple styling made on CSS to give order to the content of the page and a simple but effective look.
- Integration with node library **marked** for the text preview generation.
- Usage of basic react hooks and javascript functions in order to update the text on real time.
